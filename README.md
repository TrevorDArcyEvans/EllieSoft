An enormous collection of iOS apps, written in _Phonegap_ (aka _Cordova_) and _MonoTouch_ (aka _Xamarin_).

_Phonegap_ was the framework which became _Cordova_ after it was acquired by _Adobe_.  This is essentially a
web page (_NSWebView_ on _iOS_) running locally.  _Phonegap_ provides additional functionality to access hardware
on the host platform eg camera, pictures, contacts, but none of these apps needed that.

These were written c2008-c2011 and probably do not show the best practices for Javascript as I was just
learning Javascript and fumbling my way through.  However, in my defence,  "Shiiping code trumps everything"!
