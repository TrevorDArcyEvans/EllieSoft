An enormous collection of iOS apps, written in _Phonegap_ (aka _Cordova_) and _MonoTouch_ (aka _Xamarin_).

## Background
<details>
  <summary>PhoneGap</summary>

_PhoneGap_ was the framework which became _Cordova_ after it was acquired by _Adobe_.  This is essentially a
web page (_NSWebView_ on _iOS_) running locally.  _PhoneGap_ provides additional functionality to access
hardware on the host platform eg camera, pictures, contacts, but none of these apps needed that.

The main attraction of _PhoneGap_ is that it provides a reasonable way to develop cross-platform apps.
The downside is that not all native functionality is available or accessible.  Further, any UI is
constrained by what is available in a web page.  However, for the types of apps I was developing at the time, 
this was an acceptable compromise.

These were written c2008-c2011 and probably do not show the best practices for Javascript as I was just
learning Javascript and fumbling my way through.  However, in my defence,  "Shipping code trumps everything"!

  <summary>MonoTouch</summary>

_MonoTouch_ was a C# wrapper over _iOS_ APIs, originally developed by a team led by _Miguel de Icaza_ when he
was at _Novell_.  The project was cancelled and the team fired.  However, a clean room implementation emerged 
soon after in the form of _Xamarin_, featuring virtually all of the former _Novell_ team.  _Xamarin_ was an
immediate commercial success and soon merged their changes into the _MonoTouch_ code base.  _Microsoft_
eventually bought _Xamarin_ and, as they say, the rest is history!

The main attraction of _MonoTouch_ is using C# instead of _Objective-C_.  Further, it is possible to use many
existing .NET libraries.  The downside was the early versions were buggy and many _iOS_ APIs were not available.
However, much credit is due to the _MonoTouch_ team who were very responsive, iterated at a great rate, and
released new versions very often.
