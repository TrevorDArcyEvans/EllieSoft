AlphabetTracer is a fun app for children up to 5 years old to learn the shapes, signs and sounds of the alphabet.


For those mums and dads in a rush, here's an executive summary of features:

- American sign language
- British sign language
- letter stroke formation

- upper case letters
- lower case letters

- male voice
- female voice
- child voice
- phonic sound
- US and British pronounciations

- random letter mode

- large, child friendly, colour choice
- simple, intuitive interface

- shake to erase (kids love this!)


Your child will learn all the signs of the alphabet for both American sign language (ASL) and British sign language (BSL). Switching to 'letter formation' mode lets your child learn the correct strokes for writing both upper and lower case letters.

Let your child choose from several voice-overs including a special phonics voice. This lets your child learn the sound associated with each letter. AlphabetTracer has pronounciations for US and British alphabets so your child learns the correct sounds for your location.

Start your child off by trying the alphabet in sequence.  Once he or she has mastered that, they can try the more challenging 'random' mode.

Your child can choose from a large range of funky colours to make their letters their own. Large, fun buttons and a simple to use interface make it easy for your child to get started and stay engaged.

Don't worry if your child makes a mistake; they'll love the 'shake to erase' feature which lets them start again.  Just keep an eye on them to make sure they don't make too many 'deliberate mistakes'!

AlphabetTracer is a universal app, so it will work in native resolution on your iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad for the one price.
