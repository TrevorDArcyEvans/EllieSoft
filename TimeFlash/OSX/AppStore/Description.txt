'Time Flash' is a fun app for children to learn to tell the time.<p>

For those mums and dads in a rush, here's a quick summary of features:
  * male or female voices
  * optionally disable all voices

  * random time selection
  * analog, digital or random clock modes

  * simply touch the clock to read out the time

  * large, simple, intuitive and child friendly interface

Let your child choose from either male or female voice-overs.  If they find it too easy, switch turn off the voices so they have to do it unassisted.

Select analog or digital clocks so your child can tell the time with either type of clock.

Still too easy for them, then turn on random clock mode to keep your child on their toes!

Large, fun buttons and a simple to use interface make it easy for your child to get started and stay engaged.
