'asciify' takes your digital pictures and turns them into stunning, HTML, text based web pages using nothing but letters and numbers.  Turn the clock back and view your pictures as ASCII art.

A simple, streamlined, user interface lets you choose an image and select an output size.  View the results and then send it via email, Facebook, Twitter; or save it to your Photo Album or iTunes file sharing.

'asciify' features:
  * uncluttered, intuitive interface
  * color ASCII, HTML output
  * choice of output sizes
  * social sharing via:
    * email
    * Facebook
    * Twitter
    * Photo Album

Please note that 'asciify' does a LOT of computing, so it will take a while on large images but the results are worth the wait.

Remember - everything looks better in ASCII!
