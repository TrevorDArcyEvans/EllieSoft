<h3>Unit of alcohol</h3><p>

In the United Kingdom, units of alcohol are used as a guideline for the consumption of alcoholic beverages. A unit of alcohol is defined as 10 millilitres of pure alcohol (ethanol) &#45; it is not the same thing as a standard drink. The size of standard drinks varies significantly from country to country.<p>

A unit of alcohol is, more or less, the amount of alcohol that an average healthy adult can metabolize in one hour. In the United Kingdom, the number of units contained in a typical serving of an alcoholic beverage is publicised and printed on bottles.<p>

In Australia, a unit of alcohol is defined as 12.7 millilitres, which is one Australian standard drink.<p>

<h3>Quantities</h3><p>
It is often stated that a unit of alcohol is supplied by a small glass of wine, half a pint of beer, or a single measure of spirits. Such statements may be misleading because they do not reflect differences in strength of the various kinds of wines, beers, and spirits.<p>

<h3>Beers</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>
A half pint (284 ml) of beer that has a strength of 3.5% abv contains almost exactly one unit. However, most beers are stronger. In pubs, beers generally range from 4% to 5.5% abv with continental lagers starting at around 5% abv. A pint of such lager (568 ml at 5.2% for example) is almost 3 units of alcohol, rather than the often-quoted value of 2 units per pint.
</li>
<li>
A 500 ml can/bottle of standard lager (5%) contains 2.5 units.
</li>
<li>
'Super-strength' or strong pale lager may contain as much as two units per half pint.
</li>
<li>
One litre of typical Oktoberfest beer (5.5% to 6%) contains 5.5 to 6 units of alcohol.
</li>
</ul><p>

<h3>Wines</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>
A medium glass (175 ml) of 12% abv wine contains around two units of alcohol. However, British pubs and restaurants often supply larger quantities (large glass: 250 ml) which contain 3 units. Red wine might have a higher alcohol content (on average 12.5%, sometimes up to 16%).
</li>
<li>
A 750 ml bottle of 12% abv wine contains 9 units. Some port wines may contain 20% abv or more, which is 15 units of alcohol per bottle.
</li>
<li>
A 750 ml bottle of 14.5% abv wine contains 10.88 units. this equates to 510 calories.
</li>
</ul><p>

<h3>Fortified wines</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>
A small glass (50 ml) of sherry, fortified wine, or cream liqueur (approx. 20% abv) contains about one unit.
</li>
</ul><p>

<h3>Spirits</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>
Most spirits sold in the UK have 40% abv or slightly less. A single pub measure (about 25 ml) of such a spirit contains one unit. However, a larger single measure of 35 ml is now often sold, resulting in the consumption of 1.4 units of alcohol.
</li>
</ul><p>

<h3>Alcopops</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>
Most alcopops contain 1.4 to 1.5 units per bottle. For example, a regular 275ml bottle of WKD contains 1.4 units, whereas Bacardi Breezer and Smirnoff Ice both contain 1.5 units of alcohol.
</li>
</ul><p>

<h3>Limits</h3><p>
Since 1995 the UK government has advised that regular consumption of 3&#45;4 units a day for men, or 2-3 units a day for women, would not pose significant health risks, but that consistently drinking four or more units a day (men), or three or more units a day (women), is not advisable.<p>
