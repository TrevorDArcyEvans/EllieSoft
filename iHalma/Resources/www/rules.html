  <h3>Rules of play</h3>

<P>Halma is a centuries-old board game. Many variations exist. This is a solitaire version of Halma with
9 pieces on a 9x9 board. In the beginning of the game, the pieces form a 3x3 square in the
bottom-left corner of the board. The object of the game is to move all the pieces so they form a
3x3 square in the upper-right corner of the board, in the least number of moves.</P>

<P>There are two types of legal moves in Halma:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Take a piece and move it to any adjacent empty square. An 'empty' square is one that does not
  currently have a piece in it. An 'adjacent' square is immediately north, south, east, west, northwest,
  northeast, southwest, or southeast of the pieceâ€™s current position. (The board does not wrap around
  from one side to the other. If a piece is in the left-most column, it can not move west, northwest,
  or southwest. If a piece is in the bottom-most row, it can not move south, southeast, or southwest.)
  </LI>
  <LI>Take a piece and hop over an adjacent piece, and possibly repeat. That is, if you hop over an
  adjacent piece, then hop over <EM>another</EM> piece adjacent to your new position, that counts as a
  single move. In fact, any number of hops still counts as a single move. (Since the goal is to minimize
  the total number of moves, doing well in Halma involves constructing, and then using, long chains of
  staggered pieces so that other pieces can hop over them in long sequences.)
  </LI>
</UL>
